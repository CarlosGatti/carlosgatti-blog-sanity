## Introduction

In this blog project, I share my studies and experiences while exploring different CMS options available in the market. I chose to use Sanity CMS as it provided a user-friendly interface and simplified the content creation and management process. This repository documents my implementation journey and serves as a reference for those interested in creating their own blog using Sanity CMS.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure your Sanity environment by referring to the [official Sanity documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli).
4. Start the local development server: `npm start`
5. Access the blog in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Custom Schema

The custom schema in this project allows for flexible content creation and organization. It includes entities such as posts, categories, tags, and more. To understand how the schema is structured and how the fields and relationships are defined, refer to the [Custom Schema section](#custom-schema) in the main blog post.

## Improving the Blog Experience

In order to enhance the overall blog experience, I integrated GraphQL into my Sanity CMS setup. This optimization allowed for efficient data retrieval, faster queries, and a seamless user experience. To learn more about how GraphQL was integrated and its benefits, refer to the [Improving the Blog Experience section](#improving-the-blog-experience) in the main blog post.
